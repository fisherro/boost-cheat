# Boost cheat sheet

A quick reference for the Boost libraries I like to use. To quickly remind myself of the include paths and namespaces. And some example code...primarily to ensure that the include paths and namespaces are correct.

## Note to self

On Mac...

    sudo port install boost
    export CXXFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include"
